**HexView Utility Tool**


Nikhil Patel

**Purpose**


While working on this project, I implemented a simplified version of the xxd command-line utility using C. My program operates in two modes. When no arguments are supplied, it reads data from stdin and outputs a formatted hexadecimal and ASCII representation to stdout. Alternatively, when a file name is provided as an argument, the program processes the specified file and produces the same formatted output. My goal was to create a practical tool for visualizing binary data, whether from files or live input streams.

**Buffers and File Operations**


To handle input efficiently, I used buffers as temporary storage areas for processing chunks of data. This design allowed me to avoid loading entire files into memory, which can be inefficient or impractical for large files.

I relied on the read() system call to transfer data into the buffer. This function takes three parameters: a file descriptor, a buffer to store the data, and the number of bytes to read. The return value indicates the number of bytes successfully read or an error if the operation fails. Understanding file descriptors was crucial—they represent I/O streams like stdin, stdout, and stderr (with descriptors 0, 1, and 2, respectively). For example, the command read(0, buf, 16) reads 16 bytes from standard input.

One challenge I addressed was the possibility of incomplete reads, especially from live input streams or large files. For instance, reading a continuous network stream or an extremely large file could result in partial or incremental data chunks. By designing the program to process manageable chunks of 16 bytes at a time, I ensured reliable performance while maintaining memory efficiency.

**Testing**


I conducted extensive testing to validate the program's functionality. I tested files of various sizes, from empty files to large binary files, to ensure that all scenarios were covered. Additionally, I tested edge cases like interrupted or delayed inputs to verify the program's ability to handle incomplete or irregular data gracefully.

To confirm the correctness of the hexadecimal and ASCII representations, I compared the program’s output to expected results. Formatting and alignment were critical, and I ensured that even incomplete chunks of data were displayed properly with padding where necessary. These tests confirmed that the program reliably handled different inputs and produced accurate, formatted outputs.

**How to Use the Program**


To use the HexView utility, you run the program with the following command:

bash
Copy code
./xd [filename]
If no filename is provided, the program reads data from stdin. For example, you can pipe input directly to the program or enter it manually. When specifying a file, the program reads the file’s contents and outputs its hexadecimal and ASCII representation in a formatted manner.

Here’s an example:

bash
Copy code
./xd example.bin
This command processes the file example.bin and outputs its content in a formatted view. Each line shows the offset, hexadecimal bytes, and ASCII characters. If no file is specified, the program waits for input from the keyboard or another piped stream.

**Program Design**


I structured the program with modularity and maintainability in mind. It begins by checking the arguments provided. If no arguments are supplied, the program reads from stdin; otherwise, it attempts to open the specified file. Errors, such as invalid files or arguments, are handled with clear messages and appropriate exit codes.

The program processes data in 16-byte chunks using the read() function. Each chunk is formatted into hexadecimal and ASCII, with special handling for incomplete chunks to ensure proper alignment. Key variables include:

file: The file descriptor for input.
buf: The buffer to store data chunks.
offset: Tracks the current byte position for formatting.
file_size: Tracks the total number of bytes read.
The output format includes offsets (in hexadecimal), followed by the corresponding hexadecimal values and ASCII characters. Special characters are represented by dots (.) in the ASCII column.

**Pseudocode**


Initialization:

Parse the command-line arguments to determine the input source.
Open the specified file or use stdin if no file is provided.
Data Processing:

Loop to read data in 16-byte chunks using the read() function.
Convert each chunk into its hexadecimal and ASCII representation.
Output Formatting:

Format each chunk with the offset, hexadecimal values, and ASCII characters.
Handle incomplete chunks with padding to maintain alignment.
Error Handling:

Display clear messages for invalid files or arguments.
Ensure resources like file descriptors are properly closed.
Termination:

Close file descriptors and free any allocated resources.
Exit with a success or error code.
Function Descriptions
main
The main function initializes the program, parses arguments, and determines whether to read from stdin or a file. It validates inputs, calls the read() function, and manages loops for reading and formatting data. It ensures that errors are handled appropriately and outputs the final formatted result.

read()
This function is critical for chunk-wise data processing. It reads data from the specified file descriptor into a buffer and returns the number of bytes read. It is used in the main processing loop to retrieve and process data incrementally.

Nested Loops for Formatting:
The program uses nested loops to process each byte in the buffer. The inner loop converts bytes into their hexadecimal representation and ASCII equivalents. Conditional checks ensure that incomplete chunks are padded appropriately to maintain formatting.
